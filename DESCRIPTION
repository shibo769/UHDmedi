Description: 
  UHDmedi is an R package for estimating total, indirect, and direct effects under ultra-high dimensional mediators (UHD), 
  including the ability to handle potential interaction effects. The package implements methods described in 
  Reference: Bo, S., Ghassami, A., & Mukherjee, D. (2024). "A Debiased Estimator for the Mediation Functional in Ultra-High-Dimensional Setting in the Presence of Interaction Effects." <arXiv:2412.08827>.
  The main functionalities include:
    - simData(): Generates synthetic data for high-dimensional mediation analysis.
    - real_data(): Loads real lung cancer data.
    - eda_report(): Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) such as missing value checks, summary statistics,
      range and correlation analysis.
    - est_effects(): Estimates total effect (TE), natural indirect effect (NIE), and natural direct effect (NDE)
      using debiased approaches.
    - bootstrap_est_effects(): Conducts non-parametric bootstrap to compute confidence intervals for effect estimates.
    - plots_check(): Generates diagnostic plots (histograms, QQ plots) for bootstrap samples.
  This package aims to provide a flexible and computationally feasible framework for mediation analysis in 
  ultra-high dimensional settings with interaction effects, aligning with the methodology described in the referenced work.
